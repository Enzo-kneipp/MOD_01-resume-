# Enzo's resume reflection

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?

My code is a resume webpage that displays my information, including my name, skills, work experience, portfolio and contact sections. The webpage is structured using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to improve accessibility and readability. It includes links to my projects on GitHub and provides my contact information. The code is designed to be both functional and accessible for all, meeting the Assignmentâ€™s objective of creating a clean and organized personal resume page.

## 2. What was my coding process?

I started by setting up the basic structure of the HTML document with the necessary `<head>` elements and then moved on to structuring the content into logical sections. I focused on semantic HTML to ensure the content was organized. After that, I added content, including my skills, experience, and portfolio projects, making sure each section was clear and concise. I then incorporated images, hyberlinks, and an SVG graphic to make the page more visually engaging. Finally, I added accessibility features such as ARIA roles and keyboard navigability to ensure the page was usable by everyone and everywhere.

## 3. What challenges did I have?

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the webpage was fully accessible. I had to learn how to use ARIA roles and keyboard navigability properly. Additionally, I encountered some issues with formatting the text and making sure the layout was responsive across different devices. I overcame these challenges by researching best practices for web accessibility and testing the webpage.

## 4. What would I do differently now?

If I were to start over, I would spend more time planning the layout and structure before starting the coding process. I would also focus more on ensuring that the webpage is responsive from the beginning, rather than making adjustments later. Additionally, I would consider adding more interactivity to the webpage, such as using JavaScript for dynamic content or animations, to enhance user experience.
